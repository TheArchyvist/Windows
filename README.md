# Windows 10 Awesome Edition
![Windows 10 Awesome Edition Banner](https://github.com/TheArchyvist/Windows/blob/main/Assests/Windows%2010%20Awesome%20Edition.png)
A Custom ISO build for Windows 10 with all the crap removed. This Windows ISO removes all of the bullshit that comes with Windows 10. Read the **What I've Removed** section to see what I removed from this ISO. I made this because I was sick and tired of Windows 10 always acting like it controlled my hardware, so I gave the finger to microsoft, and learned how to make custom image files.

Don't trust this Custom ISO? Follow my [**step-by-step guide**](https://github.com/TheArchyvist/Windows-10-Awesome-Edition/wiki/Build-Your-Own-Flavor-of-Windows!) on the Wiki!

_Note: This edition wouldn't be possible with out the work of all the prviacy aware tech-enthusiasts out there, so be sure to check out the sources portion of this readme to see my original sources!_

## What I Removed
This section goes through the various things that I've done to the Windows ISO to make it lighter and run better. I did keep gaming in mind when creating this ISO, so I kept .NET 3.5 installed. I used [Major Geeks WinToolKit](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/win_toolkit.html) Component Remover to remove a lot of the following useless components.

**Version of Windows Used: Windows 10 20H2**

**Flavor of Widnows: Pro**
